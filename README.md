# Code challenge

This repository is there to help you bootstrap and initiate the project.

## Applications

- [Frontend](./frontend/README.md)
- [Backend](./backend/README.md)

Everything in this repo is customizable, even the already existing files, just make sure to document how to run the project in this README after you finish the challenge, so the review process is easier.

Good luck in the challenge! :)
